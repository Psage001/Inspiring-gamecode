I love games a lot and decided i wanted to create a tic tac toe game to further practise my coding skills.
The game should be done in python and should be an application than can run smootly.

I figured i first had to create a board with 9 different places. Then i had to make designated players.
I also identified that i should have different states for to check if someone won,restet game, start game and when its the players move.
I did constant error handling and troubleshooted multile times going on the internet and looking up examples.
